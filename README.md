# Targeting EEG/LFP Synchrony with Neural Nets
This is the code for 'Targeting EEG/LFP Synchrony with Neural Nets' (SyncNet). Input data format is Number x channel x time. The sample code gives the result of the synthetic dataset. 

For a quick start, run make_synthetic_data.m to get toy.mat as toy EEG data. Then run SyncNet.py to test the SyncNet performance on the toy EEG data.
